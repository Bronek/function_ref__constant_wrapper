# Abstract

The lack of LEWG consensus during the Sofia to replace `nontype` with
`constant_wrapper` as a `function_ref` parameter has reportedly surprised
some members of LWG. Plausibly, it might have also surprised the wider C++ community.
This paper is an attempt to explain the process and the rationale behind the (lack of)
decision for such a change.

# Polls taken

During the discussion on [@P3740R1] in Sofia,
LEWG took a series of polls which ultimately led to the decision to keep `nontype`
parameters in `function_ref` constructors and rename it, rather than replace `nontype`
with `constant_wrapper`, while opening a path for a possible NB comment which might
request such a change.

First, the following three polls were taken as popularity contest:

> **POLL:**  Forward “P3740R1: Last chance to fix `std::nontype`” selecting Option A
> (change from `nontype` to `constant_wrapper`, also add overloads to other function wrappers (`std::function`)) to LWG
>
> SF | F | N | A | SA
> ---|---|---|---|---
> 0  | 4 | 0 | 7 | 8
>
> Outcome: No consensus for change
>
> **POLL:** Forward “P3740R1: Last chance to fix `std::nontype`” selecting Option A
> (change from `nontype` to `constant_wrapper`, DO NOT add overloads to other function wrappers (`std::function`)) to LWG
>
> SF | F | N | A | SA
> ---|---|---|---|---
> 6  | 7 | 2 | 6 | 0
>
> Outcome: Weak consensus in favor
>
> **POLL:** Forward “P3740R1: Last chance to fix `std::nontype`” selecting Option B
> (rename `std::nontype` to `std::constant_arg`) to LWG
>
> SF | F | N | A | SA
> ---|---|---|---|---
> 7  | 9 | 2 | 2 | 1
>
> Outcome: Consensus in favour

As a result of the popularity contest, the Option B was assumed to have become the "status quo",
and the two options with (some) consensus have been pitted against each other in the final poll:

> **POLL:** Forward “P3740R1: Last chance to fix `std::nontype`” selecting Option A
> (change from `nontype` to `constant_wrapper`, DO NOT add overloads to other function wrappers
> (`std::function`)) instead of Option B (rename `std::nontype` to `std::constant_arg`) to LWG
>
> SF | F | N | A | SA
> ---|---|---|---|---
> 9  | 4 | 2 | 4 | 4
>
> Outcome: No consensus for change.

The final notes from the meeting do recognize that Option B has received fewer votes than the limited Option A:

> The second poll had no consensus, but got more votes toward the more extensive change
> (remove `nontype` and replace with `constant_wrapper` in `funtion_ref` only).
> This will need to be discussed again if an NB comment is submitted for C++26.

# Discussion

During the discussion leading to polls taken above, I have argued strongly against replacing `nontype` with `constant_wrapper`
as a parameter for `function_ref` construtors, instead arguing for renaming `nontype` to something that better reflects its
use as a `function_ref` parameter.

This was informed by my [@implementation] experience replacing `nontype` with `constant_wrapper` in
reference implementations of `function_ref`, `move_only_function` and `function`. The problem was not
related to implementation (that was the easy part). It was the discovery of inconsistency
between different types of function wrappers which would potentially lead the users to write error-prone C++ code,
had such change been made in the standard library.

## Why does `function_ref` take a `nontype` parameter ?

The details can be found in [@P2472R3], but the short version is that it provides
`function_ref` with a type-erasing constructor from a member function or a free
function. The mechanics of this constructor is simple:

* initialize the exposition-only `thunk-ptr` with the address of a function which wraps the `invoke_r` call taking
  the value template parameter of `nontype` as a first parameter, and optionally second parameter to be dereferenced from `bound-entity`
* initialize the exposition-only `bound-entity` with the optional second constructor parameter (if it is a pointer) or
  its address (if it is a reference)

This allows the `function_ref` to, for example, wrap a pointer to a member function _and_ the object reference
to call it with.

## Would other function wrappers benefit from taking a `nontype` wrapper ?

Potentially. In particular `move_only_function` and `copyable_function`, which both apply small size optimization, might be able
to use space more efficiently, if they performed type-erasure from a `nontype` wrapper (similarly like `function_ref` does) when
instantiating the wrapper to call target.

However, a similar optimization opportunity can be also created without the use of `nontype`. A function wrapper might
recognize that an invocable passed to its constructor is stateless (e.g. by application of `is_empty` trait) and then simply do not
waste space trying to store such non-state.

## Is there a proposal to add such constructors to other function wrappers ?

Initial work has been done by Zhihao Yuan and (separately) by Tomasz Kamiński.

## What's the problem with replacing `nontype` with `constant_wrapper` ?

In short, `constant_wrapper` has its own `operator()`, with its own semantics which might, or might not,
be compatible with an arbitrary invocable used to instantiate it.

More specifically, `operator()` in `constant_wrapper` is defined in [@P2781R8] as:

```c++
template<constexpr-param T, constexpr-param... Args>
  constexpr auto operator()(this T, Args...) noexcept
  requires requires(Args...) { constant_wrapper<T::value(Args::value...)>(); }
    { return constant_wrapper<T::value(Args::value...)>{}; }
```

Please note that the return type is an instance of `constant_wrapper`, which will fail compilation if the return type
returned from the invocation `T::value(Args::value...)` is _not_ a structural type. Also, the call parameters are all
expected to have `value` static data member, which is extracted inside the call. There is nothing wrong with this,
because the design goal of `constant_wrapper`  is to provide C++ users with
a _more useful_ compile-time constant (compared to `integral_constant`). However it also means that an invocable
returning an _arbitrary_ (including non-structural) type _cannot_ be used with `constant_wrapper::operator()`. This
is by design, and (in my humble opinion) it's _good_.

When trying to use `constant_wrapper` in place of `nontype`, the workaround for this limitation is obvious: do not
try to invoke the `constant_wrapper`, just unwrap its template parameter, via the `value` static data mamber.
This is what I did and it worked.

## It worked, so what's the problem ?

Currently no other function wrapper has this functionality.  However, the C++26 status quo is that
`constant_wrapper`, instantiated with a value of a compatible type, is also an invocable, and it can be used to construct any
function wrapper (with matching template parameters). The behaviour and semantics of such function wrapper will
be different compared to a `function_ref` constructed with `nontype`, because of the semantics of `constant_wrapper::operator()`.
This difference will be most stark if the invocable used to instantiate `nontype` or `constant_wrapper`
is a functor user type with overloaded function call operators, or with a templated function call operator (as a niebloid might be).
In short, it is not safe to _just_ substitute `nontype` with a `constant_wrapper`.

This means that:

* if `nontype` was replaced by `constant_wrapper` as a construction parameter to `function_ref` _and_
* a user performed a (seemingly) simple refactoring by swapping a standard function wrapper with another standard function wrapper (e.g. to benefit from the
low cost of `function_ref` or to use the data storage in other wrappers) where the constructor happens to rely on `constant_wrapper`

... any of the following might happen:

* the program will continue to work as designed
* the program will fail to compile
* the program will continue to compile and "work", but with subtly changed behaviour

In order to prevent the last two happening, we would have to do some of the following:

* revisit `operator()` in `constant_wrapper` i.e. [@P2781R8]
* revisit `nontype` parameter in `function_ref` i.e. [@P2472R3] and [[@P0792R14]]
* add similar overloads to other functional wrappers (see first poll taken)
* define specialization of `invoke` and `invoke_r` for `constant_wrapper` to use the extracted `value` rather than call `operator()` directly

## Example user code breakage

In the following code excerpt, `foo_t` is a niebloid providing two different overloads of `operator()`, selected
by means of a `requires` clause.

```c++
static constexpr struct foo_t final
{
    constexpr auto operator()(auto &&...args) const -> int
        requires(std::integral<std::remove_cvref_t<decltype(args)>> && ...)
    {
        return (0 + ... + args);
    }

    constexpr auto operator()(auto &&...args) const -> int
        requires(std::integral<
                     decltype(std::remove_cvref_t<decltype(args)>::value)> &&
                 ...)
    {
        return sizeof...(args);
    }

} foo = {};
```

The second overload matches types providing a `value` static data member, just like `constant_wrapper` or a `baz_t` type presented below:

```c++
static constexpr struct baz_t final
{
    static constexpr int value = 2;
} baz = {};
```

The `foo` object is used to instantiate a `constant_wrapper`, from which a `move_only_function<int(baz_t)> fn` is constructed:

```c++
auto main() -> int
{
    move_only_function<int(baz_t)> fn(cw<foo>);
    assert(fn(baz) == 2);
}
```

The `assert` will succeed if the top overloaded `operator()` in `foo_t` is selected. This is guaranteed by `constant_wrapper::operator()`,
which unwraps `value` from `baz_t`.

If the user were to switch their code from `move_only_function` to `function_ref`, altered from taking `nontype` to instead take `constant_wrapper`
as a constructor parameter, then the constructor will unwrap `value` from `constant_wrapper` rather than rely on call to `constant_wrapper::operator()`.
As a result, the second overload of `operator()` in `foo_t` will be selected, and the assert will fail:

```c++
auto main() -> int
{
    function_ref<int(baz_t)> fn(cw<foo>);
    assert(fn(baz) == 2); // assertion failure
}
```

This demonstration also is [@available] at github.

## What about change in `invoke` and `invoke_r` ?

The last option suggested above, which nobody is proposing and which (in my opinion) is _not_ sensible, would "fix"
the problem, preventing breakage when the user code is switched from one standard function wrapper to another (when the
constructor call relies on on `constant_wrapper` parameter), at the cost of imbuing the `constant_wrapper` with
_dual_ invocation semantics:

* direct call defined in `operator()`, as stated in [@P2781R8] _and_
* call into the value template parameter, via `value` static data member, with `invoke` and `invoke_r`

These dual semantics mean that we have moved the problem from one place to another. A user would not
expect that a change in their code from `invoke` (or `invoke_r`) to function call syntax, might make the
program fail to compile or worse, change its behaviour.

This is just making things worse.

# Summary

LEWG did the right thing in Sofia by not replacing `nontype` constructor parameters in `function_ref` with
`constant_wrapper`. Had this been done, we would have to either revisit several other design decision taken previously
or risk users' code breaking (sometimes subtly) when they move between different standard function wrappers.

# Future

I suggest we should pursue the following:

* Rename `nontype` to better reflect its current use in `function_ref` constructor (this is the _only_ use of `nontype` type in C++26). This _has_ to be done in C++26, possibly via NB comment
* Extend such newly named type with function call semantics that does not break user expectations, while preserving its lack of state
* Consider optimizing other function wrappers for such a stateless constructor parameter, possibly as a QoI.
